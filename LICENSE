This little garden of love,  
these fluttering butterflies, letters, and dreams,were created with heart and soul by Basharul - Alam - Mazu for someone incredibly special.

You are welcome to:

- 🌸 Read the words
- 🌸 Feel the love
- 🌸 Smile at the dreams
- 🌸 Be inspired to create your own love story

But please don't:

- ❌ Steal the soul behind it
- ❌ Sell it or use it for anything commercial
- ❌ Remove the name of the one who wrote it with love

If you wish to reuse parts of this project  
(for your own personal love story 🌸),  
feel free — just leave a little note  
saying "inspired by Basharul - Alam - Mazu's Whispers of a Butterfly".

Remember:  
Love, like butterflies, is free —  
but respect keeps it beautiful. 🦋

Made with endless love,  
under the endless sky,  
for the one who makes my heart flutter. ❤️
